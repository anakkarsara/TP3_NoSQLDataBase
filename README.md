# TP3_NoSQLDataBase

  The project's main purpose is to understand the pros and cons of a NoSQL database, also to discover the different types of the NoSQL databases.
Here, we're going to develop an application that uses Morphia to map our Java objects into a document-oriented database like MongoDB.
Then, we will compare it with a key-value database like Redis.
